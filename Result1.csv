0,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Change to Registration-Immediate effect,adamhanlon,"April 8, 2022","Dear Community,
I have decided that with immediate effect, all memberships will have to be admin approved.
Email addresses still need to be verified and a post made in the Introductions forum as is currently the case.

We have a small number of unscrupulous individuals trying to defraud community members in the Classifieds, and this is to try and control their access.

I plan for this to be a short term change...but will keep you all in the loop!

Thank you

Adam

Just a question: With the recent uproar  awareness about Adam being AWOL for a long-ish time and some (many, most, but not all) posters finally becoming slightly more aware of the ambiguous situation of the site...
Have people stopped using wetpixel? Are metrics trailing off? Special editors no longer contributing? Fewer new threads? Fewer posts? No new articles? Or is it going gang-busters?
Mods: can you / are you allowed to post metrics on recent activity?
I am not looking for opinions. I have my own, it is very weak with no facts and could be wrong. I am asking for facts from some people that have access to the raw data.
Is wetpixel.com dying? Or maybe already dead and it does not know it yet?
If contributions are tailing off, then I claim that the value of wetpixel.com is capped as a historical entity. It could be usurped (I had to look that up and it is slightly the wrong word) by a new pretender. If it is moribund (I also had to look that up - too many special words in this post!) then someone illegally hijacking some of the content seems okay as their starting point (sue me!)

As a moderator we can only speak for the forum, which we moderate, and not the website or other elements of Wetpixel. 
We have no access to the metrics. Anecdotally, as far as I can see, there is little change to forum contributions which remain about the same volume and content: a mix of technical discussion and buying and selling. We all want the forum to continue In its role of a very high quality meeting place for the exchange of ideas, information and member to member business  
Many members have raised, concerns, as you will have seen. It remains the case that Adam is the owner and controls Wetpixel.
One of the things as a mod we try to do, is stop threads sprouting off in all sorts of directions; to try to maintain some sort of coherence. My suggestion would be that we have two threads for this. One a general discussion of What’s Happening; and another more detailed look at a possible way forward - for which there has been some initial discussion. "

6,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,A useful product,Crayfish,July 15,"Hi guys Alex here (Crayfish) I'v been an underwater photographer and member for many years and I don't want to make this a commercial post just an announcement I have emailed Adam to try and get a front page write up. But I understand from a recent post that he might be under the weather so my thoughts and prays are with him.
Just wanting yours thoughts and hopefully your support, I v come up with a Mat for rolling out and using to work on camera gear at home or away comes in Camera brand colours and there is a range for underwater photographers .
I came up with the idea after doing a lot of shore diving and struggling to find somewhere clean to work on my housing where I'm not going to get contaminants on or in the camera or housing. Also good to use at home or in a hotel when setting up.
Anyway I v just launched my website have a look and tell me what you think won't add a link but site name is thecameramat.com
Admin please delete if not appropriate or breaking any rules.

7,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes to Classifieds Forum-please read!,adamhanlon,"April 4, 2018","Dear Wetpixel community,
I am trying out a new policy for posts in the Classifieds forum.
It now requires a minimum of three posts (in any of the other forums) before members can post for sale ads or respond to posts in the forum.
There are two reasons for this:
1. Wetpixel is a vibrant community of individuals that willing and selflessly share their experiences and knowledge. The Classifieds section is there for members of our community to recycle their used gear.
We welcome new members to our community but we do not want to become simply a cheap way for people to sell used gear.
2. Practically, Wetpixel is a very safe way to buy and sell, with thousands of mutually beneficial transactions. However, like all online communities, there are those that seek to defraud people via fraudulent transactions.
Hopefully, requiring a number of posts prior to allowing interactions on the Classifieds forum will increase the security of transactions, and allow buyers/sellers to formulate better opinions about their prospective buyers/sellers.
I am relatively open minded about this new policy and will assess it and revise as appropriate. Please feel free to add any opinions to this thread too.
Adam"
8,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes to Classifieds Forum-please read!,SwiftFF5,"April 4, 2018","I like this policy, thanks. I am a member of another forum that requires 25 posts before gaining the ability to post classifieds ads, so this is still only mildly burdensome and should not pose any serious inconvenience to ""real"" members of Wetpixel."

    Except that this policy would not affect purchasers (unless they are trying to post a ""WTB"" ad), but rather the sellers - and is designed specifically in attempt to offer at least a little protection for the purchaser, since they are the ones sending money just as you say.

  There’s a slightly weird quirk on the system that posts often appear initially as coming from a guest. But this changes quickly to the proper poster’s user name as, hopefully, you experienced.

    Yep, you need to comment on something someone has written or write something yourself 3 times. You can then list items on the Classifieds. So comment 3 times will do it.
  Hope that helps. If not, drop me a PM and I'll explain in more detail.

  Finding your way around the WP website and using all the Forum's features does take a bit of practice! Some of it is a bit confusing sometimes - but, hey, the advice and the willingness of people to chip-in and offer some fascinating insights make it one of the best forums I have used.

 "
33,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"January 22, 2018","Wetpixel has been a vibrant venue for the discussion of underwater imagery for nearly ten years. We have always been somewhat unique because we are a place where industry members mingle openly with non-industry members.
Recently, a few industry members have crossed the line of commercialism, so we are putting in some strict rules for industry members to follow. Ideally, every member would be 100% objective, but this is simply not the case. When one industry member is allowed to post something self-promoting, it brings down Wetpixel's integrity and causes other industry members to complain. Unfortunately, the only solution is to implement a double standard. This does not affect non-industry members.

Starting now, overtly commercial posts from industry members will be deleted without warning.

Industry members, here are some guidelines to help you keep your posts within policy:

- In your area of commercial endeavor, only factual posts and support posts are allowed. So if you are a housing manufacturer or retailer, you can post opinions about diving destinations, but not opinions about any underwater housing on the market (including your own).

- No product announcements. All product announcements must be made via press release on the front page by contacting Wetpixel. Note that non-industry members *can* post links to announcements. Sorry, but this is how it is going to have to be.

- No inventory announcements (e.g. ""Strobe XX is in stock!"").

- No reviews of your own product.

- No unsolicited sales contact with forum members via the Wetpixel personal message system. Replies or support enquiries can still be communicated via PM, although in the later case, you are encouraged to do so via the forum where others can share in your knowledge and experience. (added 03/21/12)

All members can help us to keep Wetpixel on track by reporting commercial posts. Thank you for your time!

As always, if you have any questions, concerns or comments, please voice them here."
34,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"March 18, 2020","In the light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its effect on the diving industry, the above policy is to be relaxed.
Effective now, diver travel operators may advertise specific trips and events on the Wetpixel forum. 
Manufacturers can also be more involved and offer possible solutions to prospective purchasers. 

We will monitor how this works and if needs be amend the policy in future

35,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,JackConnick,"March 18, 2020",I would hope this also applies to UWP retailers to offer solutions and links to appropriate products and announcements within reason. We are as hard hit as anyone and many are small businesses.

Eric worked for 17 years to build Wetpixel in an active and vibrant community where techniques, imagery, and information are freely shared.

Wetpixel will continue to run and function as it does now, with exciting new features and further developments being added over the next few months. We are very excited about Wetpixel’s future! Please keep checking back on Wetpixel.com for updates and future plans.

  Those of you logging on this morning will notice some changes in the forum structure.
  We decided to rationalize the number of forums. The growth of social media, despite its shortcomings as as a venue for finding advice, has somewhat reduced the number of posts that are being made here, so it makes sense to reduce forums that have been used less.
  Suffice to say that (hopefully) no posts have been removed and the search function still works to find existing ones. The goal is maintain the the amazing amount of information and support available, without the somewhat bloated structure.

151,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Embedding media on the new Wetpixel,liquidguru,"February 21, 2013",Good to have an upgrade. Thanks. But this means that every bit of video that has ever been posted/embedded here now no longer displays?
152,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Embedding media on the new Wetpixel,echeng,"February 21, 2013",That is true. I'll add to my list a TODO item to go back and revive all of them.

...I'd love to support Flickr images, as well, but their embeds are a little more complicated. I have to give it another try.
  Any other embed desires?
I noticed that if you link to the 'set' link in Flickr, it shows up automatically as a flash-based slide show here. Just checked and one I posted like that before the migration still works. I think Flickr is just fine, with this."

The regexp system here for matching is a bit weird, and I can't find a way to match only embedded video while leaving other Flickr links alone. So your Flickr URLs should all work again without creating the empty embed. Flickr sets still work."

  Edit: Thanks for the site by the way.
