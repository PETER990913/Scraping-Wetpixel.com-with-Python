0,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Change to Registration-Immediate effect,adamhanlon,"April 8, 2022","Dear Community,
I have decided that with immediate effect, all memberships will have to be admin approved.
Email addresses still need to be verified and a post made in the Introductions forum as is currently the case.

We have a small number of unscrupulous individuals trying to defraud community members in the Classifieds, and this is to try and control their access.

I plan for this to be a short term change...but will keep you all in the loop!

Thank you

Adam

Just a question: With the recent uproar  awareness about Adam being AWOL for a long-ish time and some (many, most, but not all) posters finally becoming slightly more aware of the ambiguous situation of the site...
Have people stopped using wetpixel? Are metrics trailing off? Special editors no longer contributing? Fewer new threads? Fewer posts? No new articles? Or is it going gang-busters?
Mods: can you / are you allowed to post metrics on recent activity?
I am not looking for opinions. I have my own, it is very weak with no facts and could be wrong. I am asking for facts from some people that have access to the raw data.
Is wetpixel.com dying? Or maybe already dead and it does not know it yet?
If contributions are tailing off, then I claim that the value of wetpixel.com is capped as a historical entity. It could be usurped (I had to look that up and it is slightly the wrong word) by a new pretender. If it is moribund (I also had to look that up - too many special words in this post!) then someone illegally hijacking some of the content seems okay as their starting point (sue me!)

2,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Is wetpixel.com dead (or dying)?,TimG,yesterday at 05:46 AM,"Hey Keith
As a moderator we can only speak for the forum, which we moderate, and not the website or other elements of Wetpixel. 
We have no access to the metrics. Anecdotally, as far as I can see, there is little change to forum contributions which remain about the same volume and content: a mix of technical discussion and buying and selling. We all want the forum to continue In its role of a very high quality meeting place for the exchange of ideas, information and member to member business  
Many members have raised, concerns, as you will have seen. It remains the case that Adam is the owner and controls Wetpixel.
One of the things as a mod we try to do, is stop threads sprouting off in all sorts of directions; to try to maintain some sort of coherence. My suggestion would be that we have two threads for this. One a general discussion of What’s Happening; and another more detailed look at a possible way forward - for which there has been some initial discussion. "

7,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,A useful product,Crayfish,July 15,"Hi guys Alex here (Crayfish) I'v been an underwater photographer and member for many years and I don't want to make this a commercial post just an announcement I have emailed Adam to try and get a front page write up. But I understand from a recent post that he might be under the weather so my thoughts and prays are with him.
Just wanting yours thoughts and hopefully your support, I v come up with a Mat for rolling out and using to work on camera gear at home or away comes in Camera brand colours and there is a range for underwater photographers .
I came up with the idea after doing a lot of shore diving and struggling to find somewhere clean to work on my housing where I'm not going to get contaminants on or in the camera or housing. Also good to use at home or in a hotel when setting up.
Anyway I v just launched my website have a look and tell me what you think won't add a link but site name is thecameramat.com
Admin please delete if not appropriate or breaking any rules.

8,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes to Classifieds Forum-please read!,adamhanlon,"April 4, 2018","Dear Wetpixel community,
I am trying out a new policy for posts in the Classifieds forum.
It now requires a minimum of three posts (in any of the other forums) before members can post for sale ads or respond to posts in the forum.
There are two reasons for this:
1. Wetpixel is a vibrant community of individuals that willing and selflessly share their experiences and knowledge. The Classifieds section is there for members of our community to recycle their used gear.
We welcome new members to our community but we do not want to become simply a cheap way for people to sell used gear.
2. Practically, Wetpixel is a very safe way to buy and sell, with thousands of mutually beneficial transactions. However, like all online communities, there are those that seek to defraud people via fraudulent transactions.
Hopefully, requiring a number of posts prior to allowing interactions on the Classifieds forum will increase the security of transactions, and allow buyers/sellers to formulate better opinions about their prospective buyers/sellers.
I am relatively open minded about this new policy and will assess it and revise as appropriate. Please feel free to add any opinions to this thread too.
Adam"

    Except that this policy would not affect purchasers (unless they are trying to post a ""WTB"" ad), but rather the sellers - and is designed specifically in attempt to offer at least a little protection for the purchaser, since they are the ones sending money just as you say.

However, I'd like to buy from a member here if someone has the discontinued lens I'm looking for laying on a shelf.  Hopefully, I'm not abusing the policy by getting in my 3 posts so I can ask.  "

We try, Mags. God knows, we try........"
58,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"January 22, 2018","Wetpixel has been a vibrant venue for the discussion of underwater imagery for nearly ten years. We have always been somewhat unique because we are a place where industry members mingle openly with non-industry members.
Recently, a few industry members have crossed the line of commercialism, so we are putting in some strict rules for industry members to follow. Ideally, every member would be 100% objective, but this is simply not the case. When one industry member is allowed to post something self-promoting, it brings down Wetpixel's integrity and causes other industry members to complain. Unfortunately, the only solution is to implement a double standard. This does not affect non-industry members.

Starting now, overtly commercial posts from industry members will be deleted without warning.

Industry members, here are some guidelines to help you keep your posts within policy:

- In your area of commercial endeavor, only factual posts and support posts are allowed. So if you are a housing manufacturer or retailer, you can post opinions about diving destinations, but not opinions about any underwater housing on the market (including your own).

- No product announcements. All product announcements must be made via press release on the front page by contacting Wetpixel. Note that non-industry members *can* post links to announcements. Sorry, but this is how it is going to have to be.

- No inventory announcements (e.g. ""Strobe XX is in stock!"").

- No reviews of your own product.

- No unsolicited sales contact with forum members via the Wetpixel personal message system. Replies or support enquiries can still be communicated via PM, although in the later case, you are encouraged to do so via the forum where others can share in your knowledge and experience. (added 03/21/12)

All members can help us to keep Wetpixel on track by reporting commercial posts. Thank you for your time!

As always, if you have any questions, concerns or comments, please voice them here."
59,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"March 18, 2020","In the light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its effect on the diving industry, the above policy is to be relaxed.
Effective now, diver travel operators may advertise specific trips and events on the Wetpixel forum. 
Manufacturers can also be more involved and offer possible solutions to prospective purchasers. 

We will monitor how this works and if needs be amend the policy in future
Adam"
60,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,JackConnick,"March 18, 2020",I would hope this also applies to UWP retailers to offer solutions and links to appropriate products and announcements within reason. We are as hard hit as anyone and many are small businesses.
61,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"March 18, 2020","Hi Jack,
Yes and no. I understand how hard hit the industry in general is and did not mean to exclude anyone. 

Happy for you to offer support and details of special offers etc. I would rather avoid links to external sites.

Let's see how this works. As long as common sense prevails (this is a community not a classifieds) it should be fine. I will assess and revise as required/needed.

I filled nearly every field. I updated my avatar but I find no option to change the background of my profile like @tomstgeorge
I'm envious
    Yep, pretty cool
Have you tried “Cover photo”? :attached image URL: https://wetpixel.com/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png"

  Hi Davide DB

I have enabled Cover Photos for all members. If you click on your name in the top right and then select profile you should now be able to choose a cover photo. :attached image URL: https://wetpixel.com/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png"

Excellent on then Spam kills!
I'm getting auto-forwards to my personal email address of all Reports (thanks Tom and Chris ;-)  Is there a way to turn that off? 
Hi TimG
You should now be able to manage this setting:

- click on your name top right and choose Account Settings
- choose Notification Settings in the right hand panel
- the first part of the page is some general settings but if you scroll down you will find controls to setup exactly what gets sent as an email and/or a notification
  cheers

137,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Wetpixel Planned Outage Weds 24 July 2019,adamhanlon,"July 22, 2019","Dear Wetpixel community,
  We are changing our servers and updating the site in order to provide some exciting new features and functionality over the next few months. Many apologies for the inconvenience, but this means that we will need to take the forums offline for around 24 hours.
  We plan to do so from 1500 GMT (1100 ET/0800PT) on Wednesday 24 July and hope to have everything back up and running by the same time on Thursday 25 July.
  The front page should not be affected, nor will our social media accounts. I will be posting updates on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Wetpixel/) and twitter.
  Thank you in advance for your understanding and please bear with us while we get the site updated.
  All the best
  Adam"
