0,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Change to Registration-Immediate effect,adamhanlon,"April 8, 2022","Dear Community,
I have decided that with immediate effect, all memberships will have to be admin approved.
Email addresses still need to be verified and a post made in the Introductions forum as is currently the case.

We have a small number of unscrupulous individuals trying to defraud community members in the Classifieds, and this is to try and control their access.

I plan for this to be a short term change...but will keep you all in the loop!

Thank you

Adam

Just a question: With the recent uproar  awareness about Adam being AWOL for a long-ish time and some (many, most, but not all) posters finally becoming slightly more aware of the ambiguous situation of the site...
Have people stopped using wetpixel? Are metrics trailing off? Special editors no longer contributing? Fewer new threads? Fewer posts? No new articles? Or is it going gang-busters?
Mods: can you / are you allowed to post metrics on recent activity?
I am not looking for opinions. I have my own, it is very weak with no facts and could be wrong. I am asking for facts from some people that have access to the raw data.
Is wetpixel.com dying? Or maybe already dead and it does not know it yet?
If contributions are tailing off, then I claim that the value of wetpixel.com is capped as a historical entity. It could be usurped (I had to look that up and it is slightly the wrong word) by a new pretender. If it is moribund (I also had to look that up - too many special words in this post!) then someone illegally hijacking some of the content seems okay as their starting point (sue me!)

2,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Is wetpixel.com dead (or dying)?,TimG,yesterday at 05:46 AM,"Hey Keith
As a moderator we can only speak for the forum, which we moderate, and not the website or other elements of Wetpixel. 
We have no access to the metrics. Anecdotally, as far as I can see, there is little change to forum contributions which remain about the same volume and content: a mix of technical discussion and buying and selling. We all want the forum to continue In its role of a very high quality meeting place for the exchange of ideas, information and member to member business  
Many members have raised, concerns, as you will have seen. It remains the case that Adam is the owner and controls Wetpixel.
One of the things as a mod we try to do, is stop threads sprouting off in all sorts of directions; to try to maintain some sort of coherence. My suggestion would be that we have two threads for this. One a general discussion of What’s Happening; and another more detailed look at a possible way forward - for which there has been some initial discussion. "

7,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,A useful product,Crayfish,July 15,"Hi guys Alex here (Crayfish) I'v been an underwater photographer and member for many years and I don't want to make this a commercial post just an announcement I have emailed Adam to try and get a front page write up. But I understand from a recent post that he might be under the weather so my thoughts and prays are with him.
Just wanting yours thoughts and hopefully your support, I v come up with a Mat for rolling out and using to work on camera gear at home or away comes in Camera brand colours and there is a range for underwater photographers .
I came up with the idea after doing a lot of shore diving and struggling to find somewhere clean to work on my housing where I'm not going to get contaminants on or in the camera or housing. Also good to use at home or in a hotel when setting up.
Anyway I v just launched my website have a look and tell me what you think won't add a link but site name is thecameramat.com
Admin please delete if not appropriate or breaking any rules.

8,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes to Classifieds Forum-please read!,adamhanlon,"April 4, 2018","Dear Wetpixel community,
I am trying out a new policy for posts in the Classifieds forum.
It now requires a minimum of three posts (in any of the other forums) before members can post for sale ads or respond to posts in the forum.
There are two reasons for this:
1. Wetpixel is a vibrant community of individuals that willing and selflessly share their experiences and knowledge. The Classifieds section is there for members of our community to recycle their used gear.
We welcome new members to our community but we do not want to become simply a cheap way for people to sell used gear.
2. Practically, Wetpixel is a very safe way to buy and sell, with thousands of mutually beneficial transactions. However, like all online communities, there are those that seek to defraud people via fraudulent transactions.
Hopefully, requiring a number of posts prior to allowing interactions on the Classifieds forum will increase the security of transactions, and allow buyers/sellers to formulate better opinions about their prospective buyers/sellers.
I am relatively open minded about this new policy and will assess it and revise as appropriate. Please feel free to add any opinions to this thread too.
Adam"

    Except that this policy would not affect purchasers (unless they are trying to post a ""WTB"" ad), but rather the sellers - and is designed specifically in attempt to offer at least a little protection for the purchaser, since they are the ones sending money just as you say.

However, I'd like to buy from a member here if someone has the discontinued lens I'm looking for laying on a shelf.  Hopefully, I'm not abusing the policy by getting in my 3 posts so I can ask.  "

We try, Mags. God knows, we try........"
58,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"January 22, 2018","Wetpixel has been a vibrant venue for the discussion of underwater imagery for nearly ten years. We have always been somewhat unique because we are a place where industry members mingle openly with non-industry members.
Recently, a few industry members have crossed the line of commercialism, so we are putting in some strict rules for industry members to follow. Ideally, every member would be 100% objective, but this is simply not the case. When one industry member is allowed to post something self-promoting, it brings down Wetpixel's integrity and causes other industry members to complain. Unfortunately, the only solution is to implement a double standard. This does not affect non-industry members.

Starting now, overtly commercial posts from industry members will be deleted without warning.

Industry members, here are some guidelines to help you keep your posts within policy:

- In your area of commercial endeavor, only factual posts and support posts are allowed. So if you are a housing manufacturer or retailer, you can post opinions about diving destinations, but not opinions about any underwater housing on the market (including your own).

- No product announcements. All product announcements must be made via press release on the front page by contacting Wetpixel. Note that non-industry members *can* post links to announcements. Sorry, but this is how it is going to have to be.

- No inventory announcements (e.g. ""Strobe XX is in stock!"").

- No reviews of your own product.

- No unsolicited sales contact with forum members via the Wetpixel personal message system. Replies or support enquiries can still be communicated via PM, although in the later case, you are encouraged to do so via the forum where others can share in your knowledge and experience. (added 03/21/12)

All members can help us to keep Wetpixel on track by reporting commercial posts. Thank you for your time!

As always, if you have any questions, concerns or comments, please voice them here."
59,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"March 18, 2020","In the light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its effect on the diving industry, the above policy is to be relaxed.
Effective now, diver travel operators may advertise specific trips and events on the Wetpixel forum. 
Manufacturers can also be more involved and offer possible solutions to prospective purchasers. 

We will monitor how this works and if needs be amend the policy in future
Adam"
60,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,JackConnick,"March 18, 2020",I would hope this also applies to UWP retailers to offer solutions and links to appropriate products and announcements within reason. We are as hard hit as anyone and many are small businesses.
61,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Commercial posting policy,adamhanlon,"March 18, 2020","Hi Jack,
Yes and no. I understand how hard hit the industry in general is and did not mean to exclude anyone. 

Happy for you to offer support and details of special offers etc. I would rather avoid links to external sites.

Let's see how this works. As long as common sense prevails (this is a community not a classifieds) it should be fine. I will assess and revise as required/needed.

You should now be able to manage this setting:

- click on your name top right and choose Account Settings

Wetpixel will continue to be the leading resource for underwater image makers, with Adam now being able to devote considerably more time to developing new features and time to the brand. As the editor for the past 7 years, Adam has amassed a great deal of experience running the Wetpixel community and is excited to maintain and expand this amazing resource.


Adam would like to publicly acknowledge Eric Cheng, Wetpixel’s former owner, for his leading role as an underwater image maker, technical innovator and resource developer. Eric worked for 17 years to build Wetpixel in an active and vibrant community where techniques, imagery, and information are freely shared.

Wetpixel will continue to run and function as it does now, with exciting new features and further developments being added over the next few months. We are very excited about Wetpixel’s future! Please keep checking back on Wetpixel.com for updates and future plans.


Eric will continue to be involved with Wetpixel as an advisor.

  Those of you logging on this morning will notice some changes in the forum structure.
  We decided to rationalize the number of forums. The growth of social media, despite its shortcomings as as a venue for finding advice, has somewhat reduced the number of posts that are being made here, so it makes sense to reduce forums that have been used less.
  Suffice to say that (hopefully) no posts have been removed and the search function still works to find existing ones. The goal is maintain the the amazing amount of information and support available, without the somewhat bloated structure.
  Please have a look around the new structure, and give us any appropriate feedback.

  We seem to have been hit with a wave of spam posts of late and I thought I should give everyone some information about them.
  First: The site's security is intact, Wetpixel is entirely safe to browse and interact with. These spammers are humans that are getting in and registering their profiles just like any other member.
  Second: The admins and moderators are working hard to control this. Once we see, or are alerted to, a spam post, the poster is immediately banned and their posts removed. If there is any delay, it is only due to time zones and folks being busy with other things
  Third: Many of you have been active in letting us know when spam has been posted. Please keep this up. The more eyes we have on the lookout for spam, the quicker and better we can deal with it. Please use the REPORT button located under every post on the right side:
    We hope that this is a temporary thing and that the spammers will get bored and go and annoy someone else. In the meantime though, we are sorry that some of the spam gets through.

200,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Unsolicited Personal Messages,adamhanlon,"March 21, 2012","Hi all,
  It has come to light in the recent D4 housing thread, and via complaints from Wetpixel members, that some people are using enquiries in the forums as a springboard for making unsolicited sales offers via personal messages (PMs).
  Whilst I can understand this to some extent, I believe that this activity breaks with the covenant that exists between the Wetpixel community and its industry members. Although currently not specifically forbidden by our commercial policy, I would suggest that this is counter to the very spirit of Wetpixel membership, and I will be shortly amending the policy to reflect this.
  I hope that this will bring an end to such practices. I am sorry to make such a strongly worded post, but do feel that this is something that should not be going on within our community.
  If you do wish any of the excellent vendors and suppliers who frequent this forum to contact you, you have only to ask in the forum for them to contact you!

201,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Picture of the Year 2011 now open,adamhanlon,"January 31, 2012","Wetpixel has launched its 2011 Picture of the Year contest. You can now vote for your favorites from all 51 winners of the Wetpixel (POTW) Picture of the Week contest for 2011. The POTW contest never ceases to amaze with the quality, diversity and talent that it produces. The public vote for the Picture of the Year will start today, and run through until 28 February 2012, after which the winners will be announced.
  The contest has a fantastic selection of prizes available. Solmar V has offered a trip aboard their luxury liveaboard as first prize and Ikelite, who also kindly provide the prizes for each and every POTW competition, has donated a DS161 strobe for the entry voted into second place. Nauticam USA has provided a $1,000 gift voucher for the third placed image with Reef Photo and Video of Fort Lauderdale, Florida generously giving gift vouchers of $500 and $250 for fourth and fifth placed images respectively.
  The contests voting page is open now so please head on over and cast a vote for your favorite images of 2011.
  On a more serious note, we will be logging IP addresses of all votes, and if it seems that any ""spam voting"" is going on, will disqualify any entries that we feel have benefited from the votes cast. The images are a testament to the amazing depth of photographic talent that is here on Wetpixel, please let the contest reflect this, not the size of your email/Facebook friends page!"
202,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,POTW spam voting,adamhanlon,"January 25, 2012","Hi all,
  The most recent POTW contest seems to have been the victim of a certain amount of spam voting. As a result, I have disqualified the winning entry and the prize will be awarded to the entry that was previously ranked second. The thumbnail that is in the sidebar will change to the new winner (I think!) and the result is now correct on the competition page:
  http://wetpixel.com/competition/index.php?...tion&id=339
  The very nature of POTW makes it difficult sometimes to detect when things like this happen. If you have concerns about any result, please let me know. We do investigate complaints, and as has been shown above, will act when they are justified.
  Moving forward, I am sorting out the Picture of the Year Contest for 2011, and are fortunate to have great prizes from Solmar V, Ikelite, Nauticam USA and Reef Photo. As a part of the contest, I have gone back and reviewed all the winning images and am amazed at just how good most of them are. If you have a winning image in POTW, it is very likely to be a very good image period.
  All the best.

204,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Wetpixel joins SOPA protest,adamhanlon,"January 17, 2012","Wetpixel goes on strike from 8am till 8pm on 18 January.
  Wetpixel will be joining a group of sites including Wikipedia, Mozilla and Wordpress in a strike against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) on Wednesday 18 January. SOPA is an act that is currently on its way through the US House of Representatives and has potentially far-reaching negative consequences for all internet users worldwide. The bill has been delayed in a vote last weekend, but is not yet defeated.
  In order to show our dismay at this legislation, Wetpixel will be ""off-air"" or ""go dark"" from 8am to 8pm PST (- 8 hours GMT) on 18 January. Normal access to the site will be available outside of those hours, but to repeat, the site will be unavailable from 8 till 8. We hope that you will understand and support the reason for this inconvenience: If a bill like SOPA is allowed to pass, it will severely restrict the freedom that we all enjoy, even on sites like Wetpixel."

  We are now using CloudFlare, which is a content distribution system. Cloudflare uses a malware IP address database and will warn users when they access Wetpixel from ip addresses that has been used to send spam (or has otherwise had compromised activity). Those of you who have ip addresses that have historically been used to spam or conduct otherwise nefarious business (which can happen if you are infected by malware) have to enter a Captcha and check a checkbox before they will be allowed access (it will use a cookie to mark the user so they don't have the popup again).
  If you're seeing a warning page, you can go to Project Honey Pot to look up your ip address to see what sort of bad behavior has been originating from there:

333,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes due to spammers on Wetpixel,echeng,"October 22, 2009","Spammers have recently started using Wetpixel as a destination for marketing links by putting unrelated content in newly created users' forum profile pages. This means that a spam message blasted out in an email somewhere out there might contain a link to Wetpixel, which would unwittingly have become a host for spam content.
  Note that none of this affects you, the Wetpixel user, the content you have posted on Wetpixel, or your private information. The only issue here is that spammers are using their profiles to host spam content. I have a plan to try to combat this new form of spam. I made some changes tonight that will hopefully help us to win the battle in the long run.
  example accounts used to host spam
  **Changes**:
  New members can no longer edit their user profile. This feature becomes unlocked after a new member's transition to a normal member.
BBCode, which is the language used to post images and links, is no longer allowed on profile pages. If you currently have BBCode on your profile page, it will still show up, but you will not be able to including BBCode if you modify it.
There is now a new, required anti-spam field in the registration area (only affects you if you're registering as a new member)
New users with ""spammy"" fragments in their usernames will be deleted automatically. If you're an established member with an unfortunate name, this will not affect you. However, new members with spammy names will find their accounts eradicated frequently (e.g. User ""Mulva Nudesto"" would be deleted for containing the word ""nude"").
If the spam continues, we may have to adopt more drastic measures. In the meantime, please let us know if you notice any spam content on Wetpixel! We know that spam content still exists in some of the new users' profiles, and it will be a daunting task to try to remove it all.
  Best,

337,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Changes due to spammers on Wetpixel,echeng,"October 24, 2009",Registration CAPTCHAS have not been working here. I'll bet they are using manual CAPTCHA killing -- I've read about companies in China that break CAPTCHAS for nearly nothing (using cheap labor). They are never going to work in areas that spammers really want access to.

Registration CAPTCHAS have not been working here. I'll bet they are using manual CAPTCHA killing -- I've read about companies in China that break CAPTCHAS for nearly nothing (using cheap labor). They are never going to work in areas that spammers really want access to.
  I use CAPTCHAS for every post, not just registration."

If someone wants to get in enough, a CAPTCHA will not stop them. It just isn't worth it for spammers to break a CAPTCHA to post a message -- yet... but that may change if it gets cheap enough!"

Do to the recent spam hosting here on Wetpixel, we're going to reset all user profiles that contain images or links (BBCode and tags). If your profile contains images or urls and you want to keep your profile contents, we suggest that you change your profiles now.
  I'd like to do this soon because some large spam blasts have been sent out with Wetpixel links included, and I'm starting to get hate mail via our contact system. :attached image URL: "

Since this only started happening recently, I just ignored all old users from the purge, which means that if you have links or images in your ""About Me"" profile page, they will still be there -- unless you modify the page, in which case they will be removed (since BBCode is no longer allowed there).
  This was a big purge in the back end. I don't anticipate there being any strange side-effects, but if you do see something strange, please let me know!"

Nicholas' breathtaking tag design features a stylized illustration of a manta ray.
  Nicholas explains, ""The concept of this tag emanated from Indonesian Culture designs. Inspiration came from the geometric and circular designs in body and face traditional Indonesian tattoos. The font is also based in the traditional Indonesian hand, writing-adjusted in 'Latin' characters."" He selected the manta ray as a subject because it is ""so full of grace and beauty that it could be a 'pattern of behaviour' for visitors in Raja Ampat protected area.""

407,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,DEMA Show 2009 coverage requires submission,echeng,"August 19, 2009","Wetpixel has been covering underwater media products at the DEMA Show since the year 2000. Each year, we have sent a small team of reporters to cover the DEMA show floor. During the first few years, we wandered around—carefree—because there were almost literally no digital photography products being announced. But last year, a team of three reporters were forced to buzz around the floor non-stop during the day, retiring to hotel rooms to write articles at night; I think we averaged around 2-3 hours of sleep per night, and by the end of the show, most people greeted me on the floor with a hearty, “WHOAH—what happened to you?!”
  This year, products that you want to be covered by our Wetpixel DEMA report will require online submission. If you do not submit your products, they will not be covered in Wetpixel’s DEMA 2009 coverage. Continue reading for full details!

408,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Copyright violations on Wetpixel,echeng,"August 11, 2009","Dear members,
  Recently there's been a thread deleted in ""Members in Media"" which has led to some queries by members who did not understand why it was deleted. The explanation is that it was discovered that particular member was actually banned 3 years ago for twice submitting other people's photos as his own for Wetpixel's Photo of The Week competition. We gave this member a warning the first time (though his explanation was highly implausible, we gave him the benefit of the doubt). However, when he did it again within 3 months of the 1st offense with a similar explanation (""I thought the image was mine because it was in my computer""), we banned him permanently from Wetpixel.
  The recent thread revealed that this person had quietly signed on again after a few months of being banned, under a different name. It is impossible for us to monitor every new member, so he slipped past our radar. Discovering who he was, we simply re-enforced the ban on him as per our policies regarding image theft in competitions. We tried to do it indiscriminately to give him a dignified retreat since his name was on the thread. However, our members are an astute bunch and many wrote in with inquiries, which is why we are making this statement.
  Wetpixel absolutely does not tolerate image theft and fraudulently misrepresentation in our competitions. We believe in the protection of a photographer's copyrights and will do our best to protect them. The forums and competitions are here for all members who share the common interest of photography. The staff strives to protect their works and the reputation of Wetpixel as a photographer's community.
  We want to thank all our members for all the support in making Wetpixel what is it today. Happy shooting!

  When we get too busy it will become tough to push ALL links we are given, but we will work that out when it happens.
  For now cruise over to Twitter @wetpixel me with your gallery link and I will retweet it (pass it on). I will be doing this with a few keywords to grab attanetion, so for you Twitter users watch out for things like #uwphoto
  If you haven't tried it yet, now you have a good reason to, your favourite website Wetpixel is twittering !"
424,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Follow Wetpixel on Twitter!,loftus,"February 24, 2009","OK, I signed up. I'm not quite sure yet how I will use it. Eric / Giles, how do you use Twitter on a daily basis? Hooked up to your phone? Just on your laptop?
Some thoughts on how you use this on a daily basis would be helpful, both for Wetpixel and personal use would be helpful. Do you think there is any advantage for me to sign up my business say? It appears one can / will get text messages - does this not add to your phone bill?

425,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Follow Wetpixel on Twitter!,Giles,"February 24, 2009","Ok, this is my take on twitter, if you google there are plenty of people giving their 5cents of if twitter is worthwhile.
  On my personal account I follow (twitter term for being interested in something) people that live near me, websites I am interested in, celebrities that interest me (@stephenfry is the most followed twitterer for a reason, he is interesting!). I also follow my friends and a few other people who seem interesting or overall tweet info I am interested in. Most of which was found from using the Search function (link at bottom of the page but will be fully integrated into the twitter page apparently)
  When you post a tweet you can have that info embed to your website, your social site (there are applications by the boat load for twitter) as well as be sent to all your followers (people who find you interesting. At the minute SMS updates only go out to USA, and Bell users in Canada. They have a guy working on the rest of the world, primarily Europe and Australia as far as I know at the minute. SMS updates are very handy if not interenet connection. All users can Update from SMS, just not receive updates.
  While at my laptop or desktop I tend to have a desktop client (Tweetdeck for me) open. On my phone i either use the mobile site m.twitter.com or tinytwitter a mobile phone app.
  my personal updates are either links i find interesting, photos, websites etc, or general stuff about me and what I am doing (the age old twitter question!) of course no one wants to hear about me brushig my teeth, but say I was going on a very cool dive, or taking some photos of supermodels OR even just having some fun out with friends I may tweet about it, or even post a twitpic about it !
  Wetpixel, if you follow us will be sending out updates from our RSS feeds as well as other random Underwater Photography tit bits that you may be interested in.
  Some good links to go and look at:
  A Newbies Guide to Twitter on CNET really explains it all from the Basics terms and everything.
5 Ways to use Twitter - Lifehack
  If you google using it for business etc you will find many great links and advice, one of the main advocates for it is @garyvee from Wine Library (great if you love wine!), he has some great advice on his personal blog http://garyvaynerchuk.com/
  Oh and lastly some random things I love on twitter. @gcal i can send new events to my google calendar, @myflightinfo gives surprisingly flight info (as well as major airlines being on twitter too!), @Forecast gives you weather. Obamas Inauguration was tweeted live following keywords such as #obama and #inauguration etc (keywords are depicted with # tags for easy searching of people using a word to be searched for.)
  The uses are kinda endless and it has become a nice subsidising tool for my overloaded RSS aggregator.
  Enough to get started ? if you want to see who i follow or am being followed by find me @gilesshaxted"

  My (personal) tweets go to my personal web journal. They also update my Facebook status and are viewed by other people in whatever way they'd like to receive them.
  Plus, underwater people are starting to use it. I posted a tweet earlier today asking where to have dinner in Sacramento (I was there to see Howard and Michele Hall's IMAX movie), and Michele herself sent me a message with a restaurant recommendation. OK, so Michele isn't quite up on Twitter yet, but she did read mine and get back to me instantly. :attached image URL: https://wetpixel.com/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_laugh.png"

450,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Forum software updated: recent PM spam,echeng,"April 10, 2009","As you all know, the software we use to run the forum has recently been under attack by a new way of spamming that involves humans (to get by the validation process) and automated bots (to PM everyone, over time). Other forums that run the same software have reported similar issues.
  We have applied a software patch that does PM flood control on the PM screen, which means that members will not be able to send more than 1 personal message every 6 minutes. This will ensure that bots cannot PM spam anymore. In addition, we have disabled BBCODE in the PM system, so it will be impossible to send formatted text (or active links) in personal messages.
  Anyone who still wants send many PMs will have to go through the normal process of signing up for a new account and posting a message in order to become validated, which is how we have prevented most spammers from having access to our forums. The initial post these spammers use to become full members are all pretty obvious and are normally off topic -- report them early, and hopefully, we'll get to them before they manage to send anymore PMs.
  We're told that the upcoming version of our forum software includes a centralized SPAM reporting and banning service, which means that as soon as one of these guys hits one forum, they will be banned on all of them. This is the same method that most blogs use for anti-comment spam, and has been shown to be extremely effective.
  Thanks for your patience, everyone. We'll try hard to make it as hard as possible for spammers to do anything here again, although it is always a game of catch-up as they find new ways to get in.
  If you have other issues, please contact us at http://wetpixel.com/contact

452,ADMINISTRATION,Announcements,Please welcome our new moderators!,echeng,"February 13, 2009","As the Wetpixel community grows, more and more talented and generous photographers are stepping up to lead discussions in the community forum about underwater photography and videography. Please join us in welcoming Darren Jew (photovan), Ryan Pedlow (aussie), Giles Shaxted (Giles), and Ellen Quale (ornate_wrasse) into the moderating team here at Wetpixel.com! The full list of moderators is available on our about page.
  New moderator biographies:
    Australian Darren Jew (photovan) has photographed much of the World's great wildlife and landscape – from Australia to Alaska; Africa to the Pacific; Russia to Antarctica.
  Darren learned to dive as a 14 year-old in 1980 and bought a second-hand Nikonos during his first year at Art College. After completing full-time photographic studies at the Queensland College of Art in 1983, Darren began his career in a commercial colour lab, then as a black and white darkroom technician for an archaeologist. This was followed by 2 years as an advertising photographer's assistant, before he took up a position as photographer with the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service, where he worked for eight years. In the early 1990s he began chasing his passion for capturing and sharing the natural world across Australia and the globe, leading photographic courses and tours to the World's great wildlife and landscape destinations, producing stock images, selling fine art prints and undertaking wildlife, underwater and travel commissions for various clients.
  Darren is the author of the book AUSTRALIA – reef, rainforest, red heart; a stunning visual journey transporting the reader through the continent's deserts, forests and reefs. His images have appeared in many magazines and books, and he exhibits regularly around Australia, most recently with his show ""far and wild"" at The Wilderness Gallery in Tasmania.
  In 2007 he received Canon/AIPP Australian Science, Environment and Nature Photographer of the Year award with a portfolio of underwater images, and he won the Threatened Species Category of the 2006 ANZANG Nature and Landscape Photographer of the Year Awards.
  Darren Jew's photography can be found at his website, http://darrenjew.com

  Ellen Quale (ornate_wrasse) started diving in 1998. She had taken a resort course at a Club Med. When she was awarded the ""Golden Fin"" award for Diver of the Week, she took it as a sign that she should pursue diving. It wasn't long after that, about a month, that she went to Cozumel and used a camera underwater for the first time. It was an MX-5. Soon after that, she bought a Nikonos V and she hasn't looked back. She bought her first digital camera a few years ago and used it for a year but never thought she would house it. But an opportunity to buy a used Subal housing came up and she jumped on it. She's a big fan of Nikon cameras and Subal housings. Over the past 10 years she's had the opportunity to dive in numerous places around the world, including Indonesia, the Red Sea, Cozumel, several destinations in the Caribbean, Florida, Hawaii, Okinawa and California. She also occasionally dives locally in the chilly waters of Puget Sound. Underwater photography, diving and spending time on Wetpixel take up much of her free time but she wouldn't have it any other way.
  In her work life she is a Certified Public Accountant and advises her clients on how to save money on their taxes. Since she used to work for the IRS, she's pretty good at it :-)

    Based in Brisbane, Australia, Ryan Pedlow has been shooting underwater for a number of years. Although relatively new to the dSLR game, diving most weekends has given Ryan the chance to turn photography from a hobby to an obsession.
  A regular diver at Byron Bay, Ryan can also be found in the water up and down Australia's East Coast with his camera in hand, as well as at various places around Asia-Pacific. With a background in marketing, he is about to embark on a sojourn to Cairns in tropical north Queensland to work on his photography for a few months.
  A regular member of Wetpixel, Ryan has decided to give back to the community after all he has gained over the years.
  Ryan's photography can be found at http://ryanpedlow.smugmug.com.

    Giles Shaxted has been working in the diving industry since the age of 15. His passions took him to the Cayman Islands as an Instructor where he soon found himself working for Fisheye Photographic. Here he adapted underwater photography lessons from using film to compact digital back in 2000. Underwater photography has remained part of his personal life without being work any longer. Giles' thoughts on diving and photography are that it should be fun, if it isn't they why do it!

  FWIW I tried just now and it worked fine. Note that if you do not put a location in you will get an error message. Are you able to browse to a file on your computer and select it? Sounds like you have since you tried several times, but figured I would put that out there, the file has to be selected as part of making an entry and if you try to submit an entry without a picture as part of the entry, could be the issue.

  I had told it earlier when I registered what competitions I was entering, then it asks again, Enter Photo in the Following Competitions but doesn't seem to have a space to enter it (unless it goes in the Title box)
  If anyone has the fix to this situation, I've got my listening ears on. I'd like to enter at least one of my Indonesia pics!
  Thanks.

  Hello Ellen,
  My pics were already lighter than 5 mb (4.8...) but I made them around 3 mb and was able to squeeze them.
  Your error may be because you don´t tick the competition (and then category) prior to hit the upload button.
  Good luck! :attached image URL: https://wetpixel.com/forums/uploads/emoticons/default_blush.png"

    That's good you were able to squeeze them in
  In my case, I'm sure I checked the competition and category (Novice for me!) boxes before the upload page even appeared. Now, on the page where I'm uploading the image(s), there isn't even a place to check competitio/category.

Surf photographers are a different breed of underwater photographers, but we hope you will take advantage of the vast amount of underwater photography knowledge here on Wetpixel. Likewise, we will learn from your knowledge, and will bow down before your bronzed figures.
  Umâ€¦ or something like that. What I mean isâ€¦ welcome! Share photos! Share techniques! The forum can always be found at http://wetpixel.com/surf , or you can navigate there through our general forums (near the bottom, Other Underwater Photography -> Surf Photography).
  Also, I have rearranged some of the other forums to streamline the topics.
  Changes:
  Conservation and the Environment moves to the Galley
Critter Identification moves to Images / Galleries
Dive club forums move to Clubs and Groups (at the bottom)
Scientific Photography and Surf Photography are now in Other Underwater Photography"

We're looking for one or two folks who might want to join the moderating team as dedicated bloggers. Your role would be to post one or two interesting items on the front page each week (e.g. an interesting photo that caught your eye somewhere, a new underwater photography gadget that we missed coverage of, a pressing environmental issue, a summary of a particularly interesting topic in the forums).
  Qualities we're looking for:
  - Wetpixel addict

Including myself. (Well, I suppose I could try for the 'beginning photographer' angle, be honestly and openly ignorant, and thus someone for other new people starting out to point at and say ""hey, at least I'm not THAT bad!!"" But I'm already married and don't really need another channel for self-deprecation. )
  In fact now that I think harder about the empty, dry days between now and my next dive, I think I'll just go in a corner and shoot myself. With the camera, that is. (Is that an orangutan crab hiding in the worlds ugliest kelp bed or did he really put the macro lens down his pants???? )

  As many people have been wondering where I've been lately, I thought I'd post an announcement. Eric, feel free to move this post if appropriate.
  Since September 2006 I've been managing the commissioning of 13 offshore pipelines in Equatorial Guinea. It's a small country in West Africa between Cameroon and Gabon and I spent most of my time at 1 degree 30 mins North latitude :-) After the project completed in early March, Sarah and I spent a few weeks in East Africa on a photo safari (pix coming soon).
  We just arrived home this past weekend and I'm enjoying having the connectivity that I missed - having spent most of my time with very limited or no internet access. Now that I'm back, I'm really enjoying spending time here at Wetpixel and will do my best to get up to speed on all the new features that the team has added, as well as learn about all the new neat hardware introduced at PMA and while I've been gone.
  So - it's good to be back among friends - hope y'all remember me. :-)

If you've done anything to the photo (crop, too much color change, levels, etc.) it should go on the unrestricted category."

Don't worry -- your stored passwords are protected on our end using one-way encryption, so you don't have to worry about the hacker getting ahold of them.

Although we do not store your passwords in plain text, the hacker may have gained access to the encrypted passwords. In some cases, the password can be recovered via readily-accessible web tools.
